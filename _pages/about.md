Aritficial intelligence & Machine Learning (AI & ML)
======
My PhD was awarded in statistics, where I focused on computational machine learning.

My educational background includes degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.

The intersection of these three fields and their applications to scientific and
applied problems are my areas of current interest.

For more on my background including publications, talks, etc. browse through
the nav bar at the top of this page.

If you are in a hurry and only want to find my publications check google scholar
which is linked on the left hand pane of the page-they do a great job keeping
things up to date when it comes to citations, publications, etc.

Other information about me can be found by perusing the linked sites on the left
panel, e.g. stackoverflow answers I've written, github things, arxiv papers, etc.

Contact info
------

If you'd like to contact me about something I've written on this site-or elsewhere-or are interested in working together on a project email is usually the best way to contact me.
If I don't respond within a day or two, email again, it's possible your correspondence was filtered by spam and I never saw the email.
