AI & ML
======
My PhD was in statistics focusing on computational machine learning.

My educational background also includes degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science.

The intersection of these three fields and their applications to scientific and
applied problems are my areas of current interest.

For more on my background including publications, talks, etc. browse through
the nav bar at the top of this page.

If your in a hurry and only want to find my publications check google scholar
which is linked on the left hand pane of the page-they do a great job keeping
things up to date when it comes to citations, publications, etc.
