In this paper we analyzed march madness brackets, clustering the teams and then
doing a random effects model.

The predictions are made for every future round of the NCAA basketball tournament.

The clustering allows sharing of information across teams whose characteristics
are similar.

The paper received a fair bit of press when published, for example the American
Institute of Physics (AIP) wrote [an article](https://ww2.aip.org/inside-science/how-do-you-win-a-march-madness-bracket)
 about the paper.
